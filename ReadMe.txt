This app is primarily designed to implement the following concepts

1)View pager with tab layout
2)Master Detail flow

This application demonstrates the use of fragments in an android application. The first page 
of the application will provide the options of viewing the viewpager, master detail and an 
about me page which will use a fragment and replace the current contents on the screen with 
the information about me.

The view pager can be seen using the button as well as menu options in the actionbar. 

The master detail flow can be demonstrated using a smart phone and a tablet. The layout of which 
will differ on implementation. The list and the movie section will be displayed on different screens in the smartphone but the master and detail secctions will be displayed in two different sections of the same screen if the device used is a tablet.

The theme of the application is maintained through the color and style file.
